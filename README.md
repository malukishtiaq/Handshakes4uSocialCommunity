- Android SDK (API level 33 or higher)
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Java JDK 11

### Local Development

### GitHub Actions - Automated Builds

This repository includes three GitHub Actions workflows for automated building:

#### 1. Basic Android Build (`android-build.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch, pull requests, or manual dispatch
- **Builds**: Debug APK, Release APK, and AAB
- **Platform**: Ubuntu (Linux)
- **Artifacts**: Unsigned APK and AAB files

#### 2. Signed Android Build (`android-signed-build.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Tag creation (`v*`) or manual dispatch
- **Builds**: Signed Release APK and AAB using the included keystore
- **Platform**: Ubuntu (Linux)
- **Artifacts**: Signed APK and AAB files ready for distribution
- **Features**: Automatically creates GitHub releases with downloadable files

#### 3. Simple Android Build (`simple-android-build.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Manual dispatch only
- **Builds**: User-selectable Debug or Release APK
- **Platform**: Windows (better Xamarin compatibility)
- **Features**: Simple, reliable build process

### Running the Workflows

#### To build APK/AAB files:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select one of the workflow files
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Wait for the build to complete
5. Download the artifacts from the workflow run

#### To create a signed release:
1. Create a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
2. The signed build workflow will automatically trigger
3. Check the **Releases** section for the downloadable files

## 🔐 Security & Signing

The project includes a keystore file (`KeyApk/wowondertimelinechat.keystore`) for app signing. For production use, it's recommended to:

1. Store keystore passwords as GitHub Secrets:
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_ALIAS`
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`

2. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** in your GitHub repository to add these secrets.

## 📱 Installation

### For End Users
1. Download the APK file from the **Releases** section
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings
3. Install the downloaded APK file

### For Google Play Store
Use the AAB (Android App Bundle) file generated by the workflows for Play Store distribution.

## 🛠️ Configuration

Before building, make sure to configure:

1. **App Settings** (`AppSettings.cs`): Update API endpoints and configuration
2. **Google Services** (`google-services.json`): Configure Firebase/Google services
3. **API Keys**: Add your API keys for various services (payment gateways, social logins, etc.)
