### **SECTION 1: Project Overview (2-3 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **Repository structure** - Navigate through folders:
   ```
   .github/workflows/
   ├── build/          # Development builds
   ├── release/        # Production releases

   docs/deployment/    # Setup guides
   ```

2. **Workflow types explained**:
   - Build workflows (CI/CD)
   - Release workflows (signed builds)
   - Deploy workflows (Play Store upload)

#### Script:
> "Here's our organized GitHub Actions setup. We have three types of workflows: Build for development, Release for creating signed production files, and Deploy for uploading to Google Play Store. This organization makes it easy to understand what each workflow does."

#### Script Steps:
```
Step 1: "First, go to Google Cloud Console and create a new project"
Step 2: "Navigate to APIs & Services > Library"
Step 3: "Search for 'Google Play Developer API' and enable it"
Step 4: "Go to Credentials and create a service account"
Step 5: "Download the JSON key file - keep this secure!"
```

#### Screen Recording Tips:
- Use a demo project (not real production)
- Highlight important buttons/sections
- Show the full JSON key structure (blur sensitive parts)

---

### **SECTION 3: Play Console Setup (3-4 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **Play Console** - Live demo:

```
Step 1: "Open Google Play Console"
Step 2: "Go to Setup > API access"  
Step 3: "Find your service account and click Grant access"
Step 4: "Enable these permissions: View app info, Manage store presence, Manage app releases"
```

#### Permissions to Show:
- ✅ View app information and download bulk reports
- ✅ Manage store presence  
- ✅ Manage app releases
- ❌ Manage users and permissions

---

### **SECTION 4: GitHub Repository Configuration (3-4 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **GitHub Secrets setup**:

   - Add each secret with explanation

#### Required Secrets to Demo:
```
GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY     # Full JSON content
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD        # Android keystore password  
KEY_ALIAS               # Android key alias
KEY_PASSWORD            # Android key password
```

#### Script:
> "Now we configure GitHub secrets. The most important is GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY - paste the entire JSON file content here. Never commit this to your repository!"

---

### **SECTION 5: Running the Deployment Workflow (4-5 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **GitHub Actions tab**:
   - Navigate to Actions
   - Select "Deploy to Google Play Store"
   - Fill input parameters
   - Run workflow

#### Input Parameters to Demo:
```
Release Track: internal
Developer Account ID: 5815054519387382632  
Package Name: com.example.wowonder
```

#### Script:
> "Let's run our first deployment. Choose 'internal' track for testing, paste the developer account ID from your Play Console URL, and enter your app's package name."

#### Show Live Execution:
- Workflow progress
- Build logs
- Success/failure states
- Artifact downloads

---

### **SECTION 6: Verification & Results (2-3 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **Play Console verification**:
   - Navigate to the app in Play Console
   - Show uploaded AAB in Internal testing
   - Show release dashboard

#### Script:
> "Let's verify our deployment worked. In Play Console, go to your app and check Internal testing. You should see the new AAB file uploaded automatically!"

---

### **SECTION 7: Troubleshooting & Best Practices (2-3 minutes)**

#### Show on Screen:
1. **Common errors** (mock or real examples):
   - Invalid JSON key
   - Package not found
   - Insufficient permissions

#### Script:
> "Here are common issues you might face and how to fix them. Always check the workflow logs first - they provide detailed error messages."

#### Best Practices to Mention:
- Test with internal track first
- Keep service account permissions minimal
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Use branch protection for production
